9) Even before Trump¡¯s order, America wasn¡¯t taking in a ton of Syrian refugees

Since World War II, the United States has let in more refugees than any other country on Earth.
But in total, Syrians only make up a third of the world¡¯s 16 million refugees.
And in a terrorism case in this country, 14 people is a lot.
It also controlled several major cities in Iraq and Syria, including Mosul, Iraq¡¯s second-largest city, and Raqqa, the capital of ISIS¡¯s caliphate.
ISIS is a much weaker terrorist organization.
That¡¯s because the countries wracked by civil war and violence are pretty far from the wealthy West.
If, as Gartenstein-Ross explained, ISIS¡¯s ¡°legitimacy came to rest on the continuing viability of their state,¡± then the collapse of that state is a major blow to its legitimacy.
Let that sink in for a second.
