Now, the Syria war shows few signs of ending and the refugees desperately need help.
Resettlement is needed now, because an organized, legal route to hope in the U.S., as well as in Canada and Australia, will disempower the smugglers who are currently charging 1,200 euros for desperate people to get the six kilometers from Turkey to Greece.
But resettlement of 100,000 refugees is important and for goodness sake, if Australia can take 18,000, if Canada can take 25,000, if France can take 35,000, then the United States, 10 times the size of Canada, can take 100,000 refugees.
We are talking about what is to be done with the very, very large numbers of Syrian refugees who do not have prior connections to the West, who are not who have no family, who are not connected to people here, and who lack the aptitudes and skills that would normally qualify them for the usual immigration processes.

In the past decade, about 50 Somali Americans have traveled to Somalia to fight for Al Shabaab, a terror organization.
About 10 Somali Americans in the past two years have been charged with plotting to assist ISIS.
And one of the ideas that is important to keep in mind is that the problems of admitting a mismatched population tend to show up in the second generation, not the first.
Sure. Well, while we all worked for our respective State Departments, obviously, my esteemed opponents over there never worked behind a visa window, because people just lie to you all day long down there.
It's all about perception. It's Hollywood in an Islamic jihadi kind of way, and they play on that. It has nothing to do with facts.
Look, clearly ISIS is not having any trouble recruiting with or without Donald Trump.They hate us, as some clever writer recently said, not because of what we do, because of who we are.
And they're not going to be any nicer to us if we accept even 500,000 refugees from Syria. That's just a fact.
