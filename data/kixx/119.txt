Peter King says al-Shabaab terror group recruited Somali Americans
Group associated with Kenyan mall attack recruited up to 50 Americans, says House homeland security committee member
Representative Peter King, a member of the House homeland security committee, said on Sunday that the al-Qaida affiliated group behind the deadly attack on an upscale shopping mall in Kenya recruited up to 50 people from Somali communities in the US.

King said between 15 and 20 of the Somali Americans recruited by al-Shabaab remain active.

The New York Republican said concern existed that some may return and "use their abilities on the US"; he also said he assumed the FBI and local law enforcement authorities were looking at Somali-American communities to make sure no follow-up attacks were planned for the US.

King told ABC's This Week that he had been briefed on the Nairobi attack in which 59 people have been killed. He likened the incident to the 2011 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
