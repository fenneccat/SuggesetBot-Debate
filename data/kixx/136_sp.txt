Cost of War in Syria Is Rising
president Trump said last week that he wanted to remove U.S. troops from Syria as soon as possible, but resistance from the Pentagon apparently changed his mind, and new reports that Syrian forces have used chemical weapons again are pushing the U.S. into potentially deeper engagement in the region, with additional military strikes by U.S. forces expected soon.
According to data from the Costs of War project at Brown University, cited by Quartz Wednesday, the U.S. has already budgeted more money for Syrian operations in 2019 compared to 2018.
The Defense Department expects to spend roughly $15.3 billion in Syria next year, the highest level yet, with the State Department accounting for another billion in foreign aid.
